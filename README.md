# Elevator-Simulation

The elevator simulator was developed using SWING, Which serves as the client for the elevator Web API. The elevator ID are auto generated and two elevator button layouts are created by default. The URL text is the service endpoint location and this client sends a post request to the service end point when the button in the elevator are pressed. The console out puts the information such as which button is pressed and the lift moves to which floor.

On clicking the button in the simulator a post request is fired to the service endpoint and the changes are reflected and viewed in the home screen of the elevator web page indicating which floor the elevator is in.
